## Get

```shell
git clone git@github.com:aadv1k/banter
cd banter/
npm install
npm run build # npm run dev
```

## Tech stack

The app is loosely based around the [MVC](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/MVC) Architecutre, and the `/dashboard` is a SPA rendered via [preact](https://preactjs.com/). Everything from the _oAuth (spofity, microsoft)_, to _MongoDB queries_ is implemented from _scratch_.

### OAuth

Here is the oAuth flow for the APP

- Check if user is already logged in via a sessionID
- If user is logged in, redirect to `/dashboard`
- If user is not logged in redirect them to [SITE FOR AUTH TOKEN] for oAuth
- The oAuth site redirects the user back to `/[AUTH]/[SITE]/callback`
- After the OAuth redirect, if the user exists (found by their email) a new sessionID is set and the user is redirected to `/dashboard`
- If the user doesn't exist a request is sent to [SITE WITH USER INFO BY ACCESS TOKEN] and data is used to create a new user (along with a random password) and they are redirected to `/dashboard`

oAuth is implemented for ![Microsoft](https://img.shields.io/badge/Microsoft-00a4ef?style=plastic&logo=microsoft&logoColor=white)and ![Spotify](https://img.shields.io/badge/Spotify-1ED760?&style=plastic&logo=spotify&logoColor=white)

- `./routes/AuthMicrosoft.js`
- `./routes/AuthSpotify.js`

### Routes

Each file within the `./routes/` directory returns a function which consumes a node-http `Request` and `Response` object.

### Models

- `./models/BucketStore.js`: Exports a class which contains functions to push local files to a bucket like [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com)
- `./models/UserModel.js`: Has functions for user creation, deletion, and updating.
- `./models/MemoryStore.js`: utilify used to store and modify sessionIDs in a global store object

Here is what a user object looks like looks like

```json
{
  _id: ObjectID(),
  name: String,
  email: String,
  password: MD5(String),
  profileImage: String,
  podcasts: Array[]
}

```

### Frontend

#### Styles

For the Front-End ![SASS](https://img.shields.io/badge/Sass-CC6699?style=plastic&logo=sass&logoColor=white) is used.
The `./scss/` folder is structured like so

- `_variables.scss`: Variables for rest of the styles
- `components/`
  - `_btn.scss`: The styles for the button
  - `_editor.scss`: Style for the editor elements in `/dashboard/share`
  - `_form.scss`: Style for the forms in the modals and the login page
  - `_index.scss`: fowarding
  - `_modal.scss`: Style for the modals
  - `_toast.scss`: Style for the Toast component
- `index.scss`

#### JavaScript

A large part of the frontend is handled by ![Preact](https://img.shields.io/badge/Preact-20232A?style=plastic&logo=react&logoColor=61DAFB) which is a minified version of the actual React and is pulled as a CDN.  
When the user accesses `/dashboard`, the server responds with static html, the static html links to a index file, after which point all the dynamic UI of the app is handled as a SPA here is the overview of `./public/js/` Folder

- `App.js`: Exports a single `<App />` component that ties in with the html `dashboard.ejs`
- `Modal.js`: Exports a `<Modal />` component
- `ModalEpisode.js`: Exports a `<ModalEpisode />` component which is used to edit/create a new episode
- `ModalPodcast.js`: Exports a `<ModalPodcast />` component which is used to edit/create a new podcast
- `PageCreate.js`: Component that is routed by `/dashboard/create/` is also the default route
- `PageManage.js`: Component that is routed by `/dashboard/manage/`
- `PageShare.js`: Component that is routed by `/dashboard/share/`
- `Toast.js`: Component that exports a `Toast` function which uses a `.toast` for styles
- `index.js`: Component linked to `dashboard.ejs`
